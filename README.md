# NR7Y CW mod for F4HWN Fusion

## 📦 [**Download prebuilt firmware to flash → Releases**](https://github.com/wishbone1138/uv-k1-k5v3-firmware-custom/releases)
Pre-built `.uf2`/`.bin` files ready to flash are published every release, you don't need to compile them.

## 📖 [**Documentation site →**](https://github.com/briand/cw-firmware-docs)
Full menu reference, rework guides now live here.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of [briand/uv-k1-k5v3-firmware-custom](https://github.com/briand/uv-k1-k5v3-firmware-custom).
> The only change from upstream is that the boot logo (`POnMsg` → `LOGO`) and the logo screensaver
> (`SetSav`) are compiled in. Releases here are unofficial builds — for upstream's own binaries, see
> [briand's releases](https://github.com/briand/uv-k1-k5v3-firmware-custom/releases).

This repository builds on the F4HWN codebase by adding a set of features specifically for CW operators.

- High-speed RX/TX switching for realtime Morse code sending in true CW modulation
- Automatic iambic keyer with A/B/Ultimatic/Bug modes
- Internal paddle support with PTT/Side1 buttons
- External paddle support with rework - allows direct connection of a standard paddle with no cable change
- External paddle support with no rework through a custom USB cable
- Macro message recording by keying and playback
- Code Practice mode with optional flashlight LED sending

> [!WARNING]
> This firmware mod, perhaps more than some, changes the radio hardware behavior in significant ways. While every attempt is made to do this in a way that allows the hardware to operate properly and within spec for Amateur Radio service, no guarantee or warranty is given to any effect of proper performance nor against damage to the radio hardware itself. Use at your own risk.

This firmware only supports the UVK5v3 or UVK1 Quansheng hardware. It does not work with the original UVK5 model; use the V1 mod firmware [here](https://github.com/briand/uv-k5-firmware-custom-cw) instead for v1 radios.

This code is available under the Apache 2.0 License as is the work of giants that it builds upon.

# F4HWN firmware port for the UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3 using the PY32F071 MCU

This repository is a fork of the [F4HWN custom firmware](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom), who was a fork of [Egzumer custom firmware](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom). It extends the work done for the UV-K5 V1, based on the DP32G030 MCU, and adapts it to the newer UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3 built around the PY32F071 MCU. It is the result of the joint work of [@muzkr](https://github.com/muzkr) and [@armel](https://github.com/armel).

A big thanks to DualTachyon, who paved the way by releasing the very first open-source [firmware](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) for the UV-K5 V1. None of this would have been possible without that initial work !

# A note for developers who intend to fork this project

This firmware is distributed under the Apache 2.0 License, carrying forward the original copyright of DualTachyon, whose work laid the foundation for the UV-K5 open-source ecosystem.
If you create a fork or a derived version, **we strongly encourage you to keep your work open source**.

Keeping your fork open:

- aligns with the intent and spirit of the Apache 2.0 License
- supports the amateur-radio and embedded-development community
- avoids unnecessary fragmentation
- allows others to study, audit and improve the firmware

It is also very much in line with the **ham spirit**: sharing knowledge, experimenting together and helping each other, rather than closing things off or claiming them as your own.

Maintaining an open-source fork is the best way to help build a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for everyone.

 ## Manual

Up to date manual is available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/armel/uv-k1-k5v3-firmware-custom/wiki)

## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception difficult,
especially in AM mode. The receiver simply does not have a great dynamic range, so stronger
signals can easily cause distortion, desensitization and poor AM audio.
This is fundamentally a hardware limitation: firmware can improve behavior at the margins, but
it cannot overcome the front-end design of the radio.
In practice, AM reception will degrade first and most severely, while FM reception is generally
more tolerant and should remain more usable.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

## Compiling and Building from Docker

This project provides a Docker-based build system to compile the Fusion firmware for the UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3. Everything is handled through the `compile-with-docker.sh` helper script.

The documented build output is generated inside `build/Fusion`, using the CMake presets defined in `CMakePresets.json`.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Bash environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, Git Bash on Windows)

### Build Script Overview

The script `compile-with-docker.sh` performs the following actions:

1. Builds the Docker image (`uvk1-uvk5v3`) if it does not already exist.
2. Removes any previous `build` directory to ensure a clean configuration.
3. Runs CMake using the `Fusion` preset inside the Docker container.
4. Builds the firmware and outputs `.elf`, `.bin` and `.hex` files.

### Usage

```bash
./compile-with-docker.sh Fusion [extra CMake options]
```

### Documented Preset

- **Fusion**

### Examples

Build Fusion:

```bash
./compile-with-docker.sh Fusion
```

### Passing Additional CMake Options

You can pass extra configuration options after the preset name.  
These are forwarded directly to `cmake --preset` inside the container.

Examples:

```bash
./compile-with-docker.sh Fusion -DENABLE_SPECTRUM=ON
./compile-with-docker.sh Fusion -DENABLE_FEAT_F4HWN_GAME=ON -DENABLE_NOAA=ON
./compile-with-docker.sh Fusion -DSQL_TONE=600
```

### Notes

- The first run may take a few minutes while Docker builds the base image.
- Each build runs inside Docker, so your host environment remains clean.

## Flashing the Firmware with UVTools2

You can flash the UV-K5 V3 and UV-K1 directly from your web browser using the cross-platform WebSerial-based [UVTools2](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/).

It works on Chrome, Chromium and Edge (desktop versions), and does not require installing any driver or software on your computer.

## Steps to flash the firmware

- Open UVTools2 in [flash](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/?mode=flash) mode (or click the Flash Firmware tab).
- Connect your radio to your computer using a compatible USB programming cable (USB-C or Baofeng/Kenwood like double jack USB cable).
- Make sure your radio is in **DFU mode (flash mode)**.
- Select the firmware .bin file on your computer. 
- Click on `Flash Firmware`, then select the serial port associated with your radio.
- The progress bar will guide you through the flashing steps.

Once finished, your radio restart with the new firmware.

## Steps to dump or restore calibration data

[UVTools2](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/) can also dump and restore calibration data, which is highly recommended. It’s best to create a dump right after installing F4HWN firmware, and to restore it before installing another firmware (or when returning to the stock firmware, for example).

### Dump

- Open UVTools2 in [dump](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/?mode=dump) mode (or click the Dump Calib tab).
- Power on your radio in **normal mode**.
- Click `Dump Calibration Data`.

When the process is complete, click `Download calibration.dat` to save the file to your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> A good practice is to rename your calibration file using the serial number of your radio, which you can find on the label on the back of the device once you remove the battery. This helps avoid mixing up calibration files when you own multiple units.

### Restore

- Open UVTools2 in [restore](https://armel.github.io/uvtools2/?mode=restore) mode (or click the Restore Calib tab).
- Power on your radio in **normal mode**.
- Select your calibration.dat file on your computer.

Click `Restore Calibration Data` and wait until the process fully completes.
